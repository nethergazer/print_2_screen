I. This is a simple batch of code that will print text and do simple math into the Windows PowerShell while cycling from 1-100
 A. First  block of code has been made read only with the "#". It shows what the commands for the print fuction are.
 
 B. We are declaring our variable for the entire problem as 1
 
 C. Tell code to run a loop 100 times 
 
 D. Create if, elsif, and else statements while setting rules for math problems
   1) If statment that checks what numbers are to be divided by, I have chosen 3 and 5.
      It then finds what numbers are both divible by 3 and 5 that have a remainder of 0.
      Replaces those numbers with the text "Mined Minds"
   2) Elsif statment that says if number is ONLY division by 3 then replace those numbers
      with the text "Mined".
   3) Elsif statement that says if number is ONLY divisible by 5 then replace those numbers
     with the text "Minds"
   4) Final statement that uses "else" to do the remaining numbers through loop as their normal number
      specified in the code below in (E).
 
 E. Tells loop to add 1 to loop each time it cycles through
